PyWeather
=========

Abstract
--------

PyWeather contains weather related modules implemented in Python.
Anything weather related is fair game for PyWeather.  Currently
PyWeather is limited to unit conversion, console reading, and data
publication.  But, future work can be added to PyWeather in any area.


Unit Conversion
---------------

PyWeather has a lot of support for common unit conversions in
distance, temperature, pressure, and volume.  Conversion from
fahrenheit to celsius, and kelvin is supported, as well as conversions
between inches of mercury and millibars.


Station Observations
--------------------

PyWeather also contains modules that are capable of downloading
observations from weather consoles.  The current list of supported
weather consoles includes:

- Davis Vantage Pro
- Davis Vantage Pro2


Data Publication
----------------

PyWeather contains a module that allows developers to post conditions
to the wunderground.com site.  Future work in this area includes
publication to APRSWXNET and WeatherNet.
